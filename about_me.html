	<div class="box1">What's up everybody! I'm Alajuwon. Im 24 years old and I grew up in the west Georgia area. Currently I attend a boot-camp known as Tech-Talent South, which teaches you different computer languages such as HTML, CSS, JAVA-SCRIPT, RUBY, RAILS, and lots more. I enrolled because I wanted to know what it took to put whatever you wanted on a computer screen. In my earlier education I attended a music school that taught you the basics of becoming a audio engineer and music producer. I am still in the process of bulding my own home studio. I also like to shoot and edit videos in my spare time. Thats something i've always enjoyed since high school. I have 7 more weeks after 1-14-2017 to finish this cohort, so stay tuned as I continue to update this webpage bit by bit each week. Its only getting BETTER!!!!!!!!!!</div>
